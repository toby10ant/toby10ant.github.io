        <h2>Bluefaced Leicester</h2></header>
        <code><img height=250px src="https://toby.10ant.me.uk/fcc/sheep/images/bluefaced-leicester.jpg">
        <ul><li><strong>Appearance:</strong> This breed has a characteristic Roman nose and a blue skinned head showing through white hair. It is well known for standing tall and proud with alert eyes and long upright ears.</li>
  
  <li><strong>History:</strong> The Bluefaced Leicester evolved from a breeding scheme in Northern England in the 19th century, hence it sometimes being known as the ‘Hexham Leicester’. The Bluefaced Leicester Sheep Breeders Association was established in 1963.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Geography:</strong> Following its early concentration in Northern England, the Bluefaced Leicester is now a popular crossing sired throughout the UK. Many types of Mule sheep in the UK are the result of crossing a hill breed to the Bluefaced Leicester, meaning its genes are found in every corner of the country.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Breed attributes:</strong> Bluefaced Leicesters are hardy, early maturing and prolific, all traits that are highly prized within Mule breeds when the Bluefaced Leicester is crossed with a hill breed.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Commercial desirability:</strong> The Bluefaced Leicester Sheep Breeders Association promotes the breed as being the most popular crossing sire in the British Isles.</li></ul>

        <h2>Swaledale</h2></header>
        <code><img height=250px src="https://toby.10ant.me.uk/fcc/sheep/images/swaledale-tup.jpg"></code>
        <ul><li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The Swaledale has a black face with a white muzzle and white markings around its eyes. Both ewes and rams have a set of low, round, wide horns. The fleece is coarse and varies in colour from white to grey.</li>
  
  <li><strong>History:</strong> The Swaledale is thought to have originated in the UK in the 12th century and is from the same genetic umbrella as other horned sheep, such as the Blackface and Rough Fell. It was developed into the breed we recognise today in the 20th century with the breed society established in 1920.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Geography:</strong> Swaledale is one of the most northerly dales of the Yorkshire Dales in England. The Swaledale breed was developed here and in what was then Westmorland but became Cumbria. It is now found across the hills and moorlands of Northern England.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Breed attributes:</strong> As a maternal hill breed, the Swaledale is hardy sheep and the females are excellent mothers and good foragers. This means that can rear lambs on sparse grazing and in exposed environments.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Commercial desirability:</strong> The Swaledale Sheep Breeders Association promotes the breed as bold, hardy and well fitted to endure the hardships of exposed and high lying situations. It claims huge distribution throughout the UK, both as a purebred sheep and as the dam of the hugely popular North of England Mule.</li></ul>

        <h2>Texel</h2></header>
        <code><img height=250px src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/Texel_sheep.jpg">
        <ul><li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The Texel is a white, hornless breed with a broad head, white face and jet black nose. It is a medium-sized, has a long rectangular body and well pronounced muscles.</li>
  
  <li><strong>History:</strong> The breed can be traced back to Roman times and originated on the island of Texel on the north west coast of Holland. It was first imported into the UK in the 1970s, with the Texel Breed Society established in 1974.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Geography:</strong> The Texel has become increasingly dominant in the UK since its arrival, challenging both native terminal sire breeds and other imports from the continent. It is also well known in the rest of Europe, Australia, Africa and South America.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Breed attributes:</strong> As a terminal sire breed bred to produce lambs for the food chain, the Texel combines pronounced muscling, a long loin and lean meat. It made its mark in the UK as a crossing sire on native UK breeds, but Texel Mule and Texel cross females are increasingly popular as breeding females.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Commercial desirability:</strong> The Texel Sheep Society promotes the breed for its suitability for efficient prime lamb production in a variety of lowland and harsher environments, with fast growing lambs that stay lean.</li></ul>

        <h2>North Country Mule</h2></header>
        <code><img height=250px src="https://toby.10ant.me.uk/fcc/sheep/images/mules.jpg">
        <ul><li><strong>Appearance:</strong> A medium sized sheep with a black and white mottled face and legs and a white fleece.</li>
  
  <li><strong>History:</strong> As the name suggests, the North of England Mule is a crossbred sheep. The father is always a Bluefaced Leicester and the mother is either a Hexham Blackface or a Swaledale. This cross was developed in the 20th century and the North of England Mule Sheep Association established in 1980.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Geography:</strong> This breed is produced on the upland and hill farms of Northern England and sold to a large number of lowland farms throughout the UK. It is considered the most numerous type of Mule in the UK.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Breed attributes:</strong> The females of this breed combine the prolificacy and milkiness of their sire with the hardiness and longevity of their dam, making them sought-after mothers to be crossed with a terminal sire breed and produce fast-growing lambs for the food chain.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Commercial desirability:</strong> The North of England Mule Sheep Association promotes the breed as a ‘top class mother of prime meat lambs’, emphasising the hybrid vigour it gains from being a Mule, its ability to breed in its first year, ease of shepherding and renown for production of quality lambs.</li></ul>
